## TwitXtract

###### How it works?:
1. The script will convert the raw json twitter dumps into a csv file
2. The csv file will have more than 1000+ columns due to all the sub-json structure were parsed effectively
3. Number of user and number of tweets per user is configurable.
4. It is a time consuming process.
